# Laser-Security-Alarm
A laser-based security alarm project designed as part of engineering coursework using Arduino &amp; sensors.
# Laser Security Alarm System 🔐


## 📌 Overview
This project is a **laser-based security alarm system** developed as part of my B.E. Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering coursework.  
It uses a laser beam and LDR sensor to detect interruptions and trigger a buzzer alarm.

## ⚙️ Features
- Low-cost, simple circuit
- Uses LDR + Laser diode for detection
- Buzzer alerts on beam interruption
- Can be extended for home security systems

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Arduino IDE
- Components: Laser Diode, LDR, Resistors, Buzzer
- Simulation: Proteus / Multisim

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Connect the circuit as per `circuit.png`
2. Upload `laser_alarm.ino` to Arduino board
3. When the laser beam is interrupted → alarm activates
